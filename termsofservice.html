      claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in
      connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
      under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect
      for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Hopper agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted
      in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and
      arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Hopper will pay for your reasonable filing,
      administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as
      measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the
      arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and
      other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
      jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief

      service reservations associated with your name, email address or account, and close any associated Hopper
      accounts. If you have conducted any fraudulent activity, Hopper reserves the right to take any necessary legal
      action and you may be liable for monetary losses to Hopper, including litigation costs and damages. To contest the
      cancellation of a booking or freezing or closure of an account, please contact Hopper. </p>

    <h4>supplies rules and restriction</h4>
    <p class="ar-para">Additional terms and conditions will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel—related goods and services
      that you select. Please read these additional terms and conditions carefully. In particular, if you have purchased
      an airfare, please ensure you read the full terms and conditions of carriage issued by the Supplier, which can be
      found on the Supplier's website. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any
      supplier with whom you elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and
      compliance with the supplier's rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares, products, or
      services. Airfare is only guaranteed once the purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued.
      Airlines and other travel suppliers may change their prices without notice. We reserve the right to cancel your
      booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion. Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous
      materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on your person. A violation can result in five years' imprisonment
      and penalties of $250,000 or more (49 U.S.C. 5124). Hazardous materials include explosives, compressed gases,
      flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and radioactive materials. Examples: Paints, lighter
      fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen bottles, and radiopharmaceuticals. There are special exceptions for small
      quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking
      materials carried on your person. You acknowledge that some third party providers offering certain services and/or
      activities may require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating in the service and/or activity
      they offer. You understand that any violation of any such supplier's rules and restrictions may result in
      cancellation of your reservation(s), in your being denied access to the applicable travel product or services, in
      your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s), and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we
      incur as a result of such violation.</p>

    <h4>bank and credit cards fees</h4>
    <p class="ar-para"> Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking
      from outside of the United States your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and charge you a
      conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency
      and therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the
      Website. In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed if the bank that issued your credit card is
      located outside of the United States. Booking international travel may be considered to be an international
      transaction by the bank or card company, since Hopper may pass on your payment to an international travel
      supplier. The currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank on the day that
      they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your
      booking, please contact your bank.</p>

    <h4>international travel</h4>
    <p> You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such
      as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry
      requirements are met. Hopper has no special knowledge regarding foreign entry requirements or travel documents. We
      urge customers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant
      governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. </p>
    <p> Passport and Visa: You must consult the relevant Embassy or Consulate for this information. Requirements may
      change and you should check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. We accept no liability if you
      are refused entry onto a flight or into any country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate
      passport, visa, or other travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries you
      may just be transiting through. This includes all stops made by the aircraft, even if you do not leave the
      aircraft or airport. </p>
    <p> Health: Recommended inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current
      recommendations before you depart. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health entry
      requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations, take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice
      in relation to your trip.</p>
    <p>Disinsection: Although not common, most countries reserve the right to disinsect aircraft if there is a perceived
      threat to public health, agriculture or environment. The World Health Organization and theInternational Civil
      Aviation Organization have approved the following disinsection procedures: (1) spray the aircraft cabin with an
      aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or (2) treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a
      residual insecticide while passengers are not on board. For more information,</p>
    <p>see: <a class="ar-link" href="#"> http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/dis... </a></p>
    <p class="ar-para"> BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, HOPPER DOES NOT REPRESENT
      OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT
      MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.</p>

    <h4>currency converter</h4>
    <p class="ar-para">If a currency convertor is available from the Service, the following terms and conditions apply: Currencyrates
      are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not verified as
      accurate, and actual rates may vary. Currency quotes are not updated every day. The information supplied by this
      application is believed to be accurate, but Hopper, and/or our respective suppliers do not warrant or guarantee
      such accuracy. When using this information for any financial purpose, we advise you to consult a qualified
      professional to verify the accuracy of the currency rates. We do not authorize the use of this information for any
      purpose other than your personal use and you are expressly prohibited from the resale, redistribution, and use of
      this information for commercial purposes.</p>
